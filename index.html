        Ali Al wardi: Born Ali Husain Muhsen Al Wardi
        24 October 1913
        Kadhimiya, Baghdad, Baghdad Vilayet

        Died 13 July 1995 (aged 81)
        Adhamiyah, Baghdad, Iraq

        orn in Kadhimiya, Baghdad in 1913, to a religious and very traditional family. <br>
        He grew up defying his family's strict non-modern-educational policy,
        where his father wanted him to learn a craft instead of reading books.
        Nevertheless, Al-Wardi grew up with a disliking for work and crafts and a strong liking for books. <br>
        He managed to finish his elementary and high school and was awarded the number one student in the Kingdom of
        Iraq. He
        later was appointed as a teacher in different elementary and high schools across Iraq, before winning a
        scholarship to
        the American University of Beirut, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1943. He was back in Iraq and was
        forced
        into marriage per his father's orders. <br>

        A few years later, he traveled to the United States to attain his master's and PhD degrees. He earned his
        master's
        degree in 1948 from The University of Texas and his PhD in 1950 from the same university. During that time he
        used to
        spend his summers in the United Kingdom learning English in available institutes.
